//    Part 7.1 - Create Students singleton
//
//Note: The creation of this class will demonstrate an implementation of singleton design pattern.
//Create a Students class.
//The class should be an unextendable subclass of the People class.
//The class should statically instantiate a final field named INSTANCE of type Students.
//The class should define a private nullary constructor which populates the INSTANCE field with respective Student representations of your colleagues.
//Each student should have a relatively unique id field.
//The class should define a getInstance method which returns the INSTANCE field.
